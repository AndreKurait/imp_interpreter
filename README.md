# imp_interpreter
Interpreter for enhanced version of IMP (Simple Imperative language).

I have enhansed it with few more operators like subtraction, multiplicatoin etc. Also boolean is just as valid type as integer. I have introduced print statement as well.

Examples of valid programs are in *.imp files
