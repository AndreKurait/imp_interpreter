# imp_interpreter
Interpreter for enhanced version of IMP (Simple Imperative language).

I have enhansed it with few more operators like subtraction, multiplicatoin etc. IMP has only one type which is Int, but I added Boolean and Strings. I have introduced print statement as well.

Examples of valid programs are in *.imp files

Link to the language description: http://fsl.cs.illinois.edu/images/0/0d/CS522-Spring-2011-PL-book-imp.pdf

Code compiles with `ghc --make IMP_Interpreter.hs` and starts with `./IMP_Interpreter test.imp`
